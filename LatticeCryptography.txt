Hard Lattice Problems

Detecting Short Non Zero Lattice Vectors (Gap) SVP, SIVP, 
For poly(m), solving appears to require 2^ohm(m) time and space. 
Need clarity on the proof of these hard lattice problems.

Short Integer Solution

Zsubscript(q), Superscript(n) is an n-dimensional integer vector modulo q
Goal is to find a non-trivial z1, ..., z(m) such that z(1)a(1)+ z(2)a(2)+...+z(m)a(m) = 0

Collission Resistant Hash Functions and Short Integer Solutions 

Set m > nlogq, define shrinking fA : {0,1} superscript(m) -> zQN
