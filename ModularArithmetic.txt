d = n * q + r, o < r < n
r = d (mod n)
Residue, Remainder = d ( In the modulus of n )

Group >>

A pair <G,*> where G is a set and * is a binary operation such that the following hold
Closure, Associativity, Identity, Inverse

Ring >>

It is a triplet < R, +, * > where + and * are binary operations and R is a set satisfying the following properties.

<R, +> is a commutative group
For all x,y and z in R
x * y is also in R
x * ( y * z ) = ( x * y ) * z
x * ( y + z ) = ( x * y ) + ( x * z )

Field >>

< R, +, * > is a commutative ring with 

R has a multiplicative identity
Each element, x, in R ( except for 0 ) has an inverse element in R, denoted by x(-1)
