## Public Key Cryptosystems
Public Key Cryptography evolved from an attempt to attack two of the most difficult problems associated with symmetric encryption. First problem is key distribution. Second problem is related to digital signatures. In public key cryptosystems, it is computationally infeasible to determine the decryption key given only the knowledge of the cryptographic algorithm and the encryption key. In Public Key Cryptosystems, encrytion can be done either with public key or private key. Encryption / Decryption, Digital Signature and Key Exchanges are the important applications of public key cryptosystems. In Encryption and Decryption, sender encrypts the message with the recipient's public key. On the other hand, in digital signature, the sender signs a message with its private key. In key exchange, it is entirely different as two sides cooperate to exchange a session key.
