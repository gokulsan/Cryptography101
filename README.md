## Symmetric Algorithms
Stream Ciphers - RC4
Blockc Ciphers - DES, AES

## Asymmetric Algorithms
Public Key Cryptosystem - RSA

Public Key Cryptography evolved from an attempt to attack two of the most difficult problems associated with symmetric encryption. First problem is key distribution. Second problem is related to digital signatures. In public key cryptosystems, it is computationally infeasible to determine the decryption key given only the knowledge of the cryptographic algorithm and the encryption key.
